                             you check in late (after 6:00 pm). If a room is not available, we will arrange your accommodation in another
                              hotel at our expense, and provide transportation to and from Four Seasons as reasonable. All reservations made
                               through the website must be guaranteed by a major credit card. Certain arrival dates and rates may require a deposit.
                                Please check for full deposit requirements at time of booking.

                            <h5>Credit Card Security</h5>
                            The credit card details page of Bookassist is protected by powerful Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
                            SSL encrypts your name, credit card number and expiry date before they travel over the Internet.
                             This makes doing business over the Internet as secure as purchasing by telephone. This ensures that your
                             credit card details will remain completely confidential while in transit. SSL safe connection and secure transaction technology
                              has effectively protected millions of Bookassist customers who have transmitted their credit card numbers online
                              and made a purchase since Bookassist launched its online services in 1999.Additionally, credit card usage is verified
                              directly through a live secure connection with the banking system at time of debiting. This ensures that known stolen
                              cards cannot be used and fraudulent transactions are minimised for consumer and hotel benefit.
